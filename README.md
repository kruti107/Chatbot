🛠 Installation

1. Prerequisites
   
-Make sure you have the following installed:

-Python 3.7 or higher

-pip (Python package manager)

3. Run the chatbot
   
-python chat.py

📌 Project Overview

-This project implements a contextual chatbot using PyTorch, designed with a feed-forward neural network and a complete NLP pipeline including tokenization, vectorization, and intent classification. 

-The chatbot generates meaningful responses based on user input by learning contextual patterns from predefined intents.
